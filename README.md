## ⚙️ Firmware

This setup is based on **RepRap Firmware 3.7.0** for Duet hardware.

Useful resources:

- Documentation: https://docs.duet3d.com/  
- Firmware repository: https://github.com/Duet3D/RepRapFirmware  
- Community forum: https://forum.duet3d.com/

The firmware is configured entirely via G-code scripts located in the `/sys` directory on the Duet SD card.

Network settings, drivers, heaters, and machine limits are defined there.

---

## 🧩 Configuration Files

The files inside `My_Config/` are intended to be placed into the `/sys` directory of the Duet SD card.

Typical files include:

- `config.g`
- Homing macros (`homex.g`, `homey.g`, `homez.g`)
- Optional probing or bed leveling macros

After configuration changes, a restart or `M999` command may be required.

---

## 🛠️ OrcaSlicer

The folder `My_Slicers/` contains prepared **OrcaSlicer profiles**.

These are tuned for:

- RepRap Firmware (RRF)
- Network printing via Duet Web Interface
- Standard G-code output (no Klipper/Marlin dialects)

Import the profiles via the profile management section in OrcaSlicer.

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Remove the Duet SD card.  
2. Copy contents of `My_Config/` into `/sys`.  
3. Reinsert the SD card and start the printer.  
4. Access the Web Interface via the printer IP.  
5. Verify configuration.

## 📌 Notes

- Firmware updates may require adjustments to `config.g`.  
- Perform PID tuning after hotend or heated bed modifications.  
- Creating backups of the SD card before editing configuration files is strongly recommended.
